The `switch` command is used to change the underlying AI model used by Genie. This command allows you to switch between different models based on your requirements, such as performance, accuracy, or resource constraints. This will automatically cycle between the three engines.

## Usage

```bash
genie switch
```

## Flags

`--list-models`: Lists all the available models that you can switch to for the current engine.

`--model <model>`: Switches to the specified model.

`--help`: Displays help information about the switch command and its usage.


## Switching Engine 

Currently the engines supported are **Gemini**, **GPT**, **DeepSeek** and **Ollama**. To switch between these run:

```bash
genie switch
```

and your engines will be switched with the default model configurations.

## Switching models

To switch models for a particular engine run:

```bash
genie switch --model <model-name>
```

You can find all the available models to switch to by running:

```bash
genie switch --list-models
```
