The `use` command is used to instantly change the engine and the model for Genie. If you don't want to cycle through the models which is done by `genie switch`, you can use this command to instantly change the engine and the model.

## Usage

```bash
genie use --engine <engine> --model <model>
```

## Flags

`--engine <engine>`: The engine to use.

`--model <model>`: The model to use.

The available engines are **Gemini**, **GPT**, **DeepSeek** and **Ollama**. These are case insensitive and you can enter these in lowercase or uppercase.

To list all available models for an engine, you can use the `genie switch --list-models` command. You can find more details about the switch command [here](/commands/switch).

## Example

```bash
genie use --engine ollama --model llama3.2
```

This will change the engine to **Ollama** and the model to **llama3.2**.
