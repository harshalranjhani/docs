The `tell` command is used for generating text responses based on your queries or prompts. This command leverages AI to provide accurate and informative responses, making it a powerful tool for retrieving information or generating conversational content.

## Usage

```bash
genie tell "prompt"
```

## Flags

`--include-dir`: Includes a snapshot of the current directory in the request, providing better context for the response.

`--include-git-changes`: Includes a brief summary of your git changes. This can be used to frame PR descriptions or add commit messages. This flag cannot be used if the repository you're using is not initialized by git and also if you do not have the [git](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcli) installed.

## Key Features

- **Text Response Generation:** Provides detailed and accurate responses based on the provided prompt.

- **Conversational AI:** Ideal for generating conversational text or retrieving information directly from the CLI.

## Example

```bash
genie tell "Explain the concept Operating System in simple terms"
```
