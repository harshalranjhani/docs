The `bug report` command helps users save bug reports in the current repository. This command will generate a detailed bug report from your description of the bug. Genie will analyze the issue and generate a structured report with:
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Potential fixes
- Severity and category classification

All the information is saved in a markdown file in the bugs directory categorized by priority order.

## Flags

`-p, --priority`: Sets the priority level of the bug report. Available options are:
- `low`: Minor issues that can be addressed later
- `medium`: Default priority for most bugs
- `high`: Urgent issues requiring immediate attention

`-s, --severity`: Indicates how severe the bug's impact is. Options include:
- `low`: Minimal impact on functionality
- `medium`: Default severity level
- `high`: Significant impact on core features
- `critical`: System-breaking issues

`-c, --category`: Categorizes the type of bug. Common categories include:
- `ui`: User interface issues
- `backend`: Server-side or database problems
- `security`: Security vulnerabilities
- `performance`: Speed or resource usage issues
- And other custom categories as needed

`-a, --assignee`: Specifies the team member who should be assigned to investigate and fix the bug. Takes a username string as input.

`-h, --help`: Displays help information about the bug report command and its usage.


## Usage

```bash
genie bug report <description>
```

## Key Features

- **Automatic Bug Report Generation:** Generates a detailed bug report based on your description.
- **Categorization and Prioritization:** Helps in organizing and prioritizing bugs based on severity and category.
- **Assignee Specification:** Allows you to assign the bug to a specific team member for investigation.

## Example

```bash
genie bug report "Cart total not updating when items removed" -c frontend -a "john.doe" -p medium
```

This will generate a bug report in the bugs directory and will be named in a timestamped format.
