The `summarize` command automatically creates a markdown summary of comments within your project files. This is particularly useful for documenting code and reviewing key sections of your project.

For this command to work, you need to have comments in your code that are marked as headings and subheadings. Genie will automatically detect these comments and generate a markdown summary based on them.

Example of comments in code:

In python:

```python
# genie:heading: This is a heading
# genie:subheading: This is a subheading
```

or in javascript:

```javascript
// genie:heading: This is a heading
// genie:subheading: This is a subheading
```

Make sure to match the exact format for the comments to be detected correctly. The format is `genie:heading:` for headings and `genie:subheading:` for subheadings. Remember to add a space after the colon and before the text. Also add a space after the comment marker (`#` or `//` or anything else) and before the `genie` keyword.

This command can be used in relation to the [document](/commands/document) command to generate summaries of the codebase.

## Usage

```bash
genie summarize
```

## Flags

`--email`: Sends the generated markdown summary as a PDF via email.

`--support`: Lists the supported languages for comment detection.

`--filename`: Allows you to specify the filename for the generated markdown summary.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Comment Detection:** Scans your project files for comments marked as headings and subheadings and creates a structured summary.

- **Multi-Language Support:** Recognizes comment markers across different programming languages.

- **Email Integration:** Offers the ability to send the summary as a PDF via email.

## Example

```bash
genie summarize --filename "ProjectSummary.md"
```
