The `image` command allows you to create images directly from text prompts. This feature is highly versatile, enabling the generation of diagrams, charts, illustrations, and other visual content without leaving the CLI.

## Usage

```bash
genie generate "prompt"
```

Note: The command can utilize different engines, including the Gemini engine. For Gemini, ensure that the SSID (from the `__Secure-1PSID` cookie) and API key are set as environment variables.

## Key Features

- **Text-to-Image Conversion**: Generate images from text prompts, simplifying the process of creating visual content.

- **Versatile Applications:** Useful for generating a wide variety of images, including flowcharts, concept art, and visual explanations.

## Example

```bash
genie generate "Create a flowchart for a user registration process"
```

This command would generate a flowchart illustrating the steps involved in the user registration process. The resulting image can be saved or shared as needed.
