To become a supporter, simply click [here](https://rzp.io/rzp/JUFHvoxw) and follow the instructions.

Alternatively, you can directly support Genie via the CLI by running the following command:

```bash
genie support
```

This will open a browser window with the payment page. Once you've completed the payment, you'll receive an email with instructions on how to access the supporter features.

## Verifying Supporter Status

You can verify your supporter status by running the following command:

```bash
genie verify "me@domain.com"
```

Replace `me@domain.com` with the email address you used to become a supporter. You'll receive a confirmation link in your email to verify your account. If you're a supporter, you'll receive a success message in the terminal.
