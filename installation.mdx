## Install Genie

Get started by installing the Genie CLI on your machine, enabling you to manage and run Genie from anywhere in your terminal or command prompt.

## Installation via Package Manager (Recommended)

### Homebrew (macOS)

If you're on macOS, the simplest way to install Genie is via Homebrew. Follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Run the following command to tap the repo and install Genie:

```bash
brew tap harshalranjhani/harshalranjhani
brew install genie
```

3. Verify the installation by running:

```bash
genie version
```

### NPM (Linux, macOS, Windows) - Coming Soon!

We’re working on supporting installation via npm. Stay tuned!

## Manual Installation

### MacOS

If you prefer or need to manually install Genie, follow the instructions below for your operating system:

1. Download the latest release from the Genie [releases page](https://genie.harshalranjhani.in/releases).

2. Open your terminal.

3. Move the downloaded `genie` binary to `/usr/local/bin` to make it accessible from anywhere in your terminal:

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/genie /usr/local/bin/genie
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/genie
```

4. Verify the installation by running:

```bash
genie version
```

### Linux

1. Download the latest release from the Genie [releases page](https://genie.harshalranjhani.in/releases). The file will be in `tar.gz` format.

2. Open your terminal.

3. Navigate to the download location (usually `~/Downloads`) and extract the `genie` binary from the `tar.gz` archive using the following command:

```bash
tar -zxvf genie.tar.gz -C ~/Downloads
```

4. Move the extracted `genie` binary to `/usr/local/bin` to make it accessible from anywhere in your terminal. You may need to prefix these commands with sudo for superuser access:

```bash
sudo mv ~/Downloads/genie /usr/local/bin/genie
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/genie
```

5. Verify the installation by running:

```bash
genie version
```

### Windows

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://genie.harshalranjhani.in/releases). The file will be a ZIP archive.

2. Locate the downloaded ZIP file, usually in your `Downloads` folder, right-click on it, and select `“Extract All…”` to extract the `genie.exe` file. Choose a location that is easy for you to remember.

3. Open Command Prompt as an administrator.

4. Move the extracted `genie.exe` to a directory that’s in your system’s `PATH`, such as `C:\Windows\System32` for system-wide access, or another directory of your choice (e.g., `C:\Tools`). If you use a custom directory, ensure it’s added to your system’s `PATH`. For example, to move `genie.exe` to `C:\Tools` and add it to your `PATH`:

```cmd
move %USERPROFILE%\Downloads\genie.exe C:\Tools\genie.exe
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Tools"
```

Note for Windows Users: After updating your `PATH`, you’ll need to restart Command Prompt or any other applications to recognize the new `PATH` settings.

5. Verify the installation by running:

```cmd
genie version
```
