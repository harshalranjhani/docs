So Genie uses two models for its AI capabilities: `gemini-1.5-pro` and `gpt-4o-mini`. These models are used for all tasks performed in Genie, such as code generation, documentation, and much more.

## Switching Models

You can switch between the two models using the `switch` command. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
genie switch
```

Read more about the `switch` command [here](/commands/switch).

## Current Model

You can check the current model being used by Genie using the `engine` command. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
genie engine
```
